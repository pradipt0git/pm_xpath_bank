Create a python, selenium application, which can run locally.
There will be one config file with load_url : <any url user can provide here>
There will be one driver folder where edge driver should be placed.
A main.py should be there from which whole application will start, for execution create a separate bat file also which can trigger this main.py and start execution.
There should be one folder - output_folder in this project 
Main task of this project - 
1. After running main.py get load url from config file and open the url in edge browser (I can not use other browser)
2. AFter load complete executor can click on any object(eg. button, textbox, label, div, etc.) of the page, on every click I need to get xpaths of that element. 
3. Get following xpaths - 
	a. visual properties like - text, placeholder, accessability properties,value
	b. relative xpath
	c. full xpath
	d. css selector path

every click should pick the clickied elements xpaths.
4. Save these xpaths in local json file, on each click update json, this output json has to be there in ouput_folder. output json file name should be same as  website domain (not full url).
5. In the json save xpaths inside each page json object. page object should have page url, page name, xpaths[ visual_xpath:{}, relative_xpath:{}, full_xpath:{}, css+selector:{}, custom_xpath:{(this will not be automatically pick, manually executor can update this manually in json)} ] like this.
6. combination of page url, page name, xpaths should be unique in the output json file
